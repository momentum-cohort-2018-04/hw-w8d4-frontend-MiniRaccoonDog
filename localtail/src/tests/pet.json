                      "$t": "You MUST fill out an application to be considered for adoption. Due to a large volume of calls and emails, we can only ensure responses to those who fill out an application.\n\nhttp://carolinaheartsrescue.org/adoption-information/\n\nAVAILABLE: Hana \n\nWe would like to officially introduce the lovely Hana, a 1.5 year old black tricolor Aussie/Border Collie mix who weighs in at about 45 pounds (with some room to gain a few more). Hana came to CHAR as an owner surrender due to changes in their living situation.\n\nHana is a classic adolescent Baussie, with lots of energy to run, play and chase. She gets along great with her foster brother, and would do well in a home with another playful dog to romp around and wrestle. Hana is crate trained and mostly house trained with a few accidents here and there, which have mostly been the result of a change in environment and some expected stress from her move. Her foster mom is working on getting her settled with routines, which should help with preventing accidents. Her former owners say she is bell-trained for potty breaks, but we have not had an opportunity to test that yet in foster care. \n\nBecause Hana is a high-energy girl, she would do best in a home with plenty of land or a fenced-in yard to run and play. At her foster home, Hana has just started going to Doggie Day Care which she loooves. Hana doesn't like to be idle and would love a job to keep her busy. She enjoys toys and playing catch, so she may also be a good candidate for canine sports. She's a tall, long-legged girl, and has moderate-to-high chase and food drive. She is a vocal pup and does bark quite a bit when she's bored or wants something, and would be best suited in a house without close or shared-wall neighbors.\n\nHana is extremely food motivated, and has a tendency to counter surf looking for any extra scraps she might find. She can be a bit protective of her food if other dogs are around, but does well with eating meals in her crate. Her foster mom is working on basic commands with and without treats - she's got \"sit\" down pat, and while she doesn't like to lie down, she will happily do so for a yummy treat. Walks with her foster mom and brother are her favorite, but she will need some continued training to remind her how to walk like a good girl and not pull or bark at the passing dogs and humans.\n\nThus far, Hana has loved every human she's met, and she was raised in a home with a small child. That being said, her size and energy level will likely make her a poor candidate for homes with very small children, so kids ages 5-6 and up would be preferred. Hana does have prey/chase drive and will harass kitties if she knows it will entertain her, so we would advise her for a home without cats (or, at the very least, incredibly dog-savvy cats and an understanding owner). Hana loves other dogs, but she will not back down from a challenge, so she needs a friendly (preferably male) dog sibling if there are other dogs in the home. \n\nHana will thrive in an environment with someone who has herding breed experience, and is willing to spend time socializing, exercising and training her. Like most of the young herders surrendered to rescue, she has simply not received the dedicated time and attention that these dogs need to channel their intelligence and energy appropriately. She would not do well in a home that she would be crated for long hours every day, but with daycare options she would be fine having an owner who works full-time. \n\nHana is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm negative, and she will be microchipped before adoption. Her adoption fee is $300, and she is fostered in Durham, NC. \n\nhttp://carolinaheartsrescue.org/adoption-information/"

Due to a large volume of calls and emails, we can only ensure responses to those who fill out an application.Â \n\nhttp://carolinaheartsrescue.org/adoption-information/\n\nAVAILABLE: Arcus\n\nArcus is a 60 lb, two and a half year old smooth collie mix with a charming, goofy personality and a perpetual wink. This absolute sweetheart wants to be friends with everyone he meets! However, he is still learning human manners, like not to jump on people when greeting. Despite months of recovering in the shelter from a painful surgery, Arcus has a happy-go-lucky attitude and is not limited by only having one eye. He is confident and comfortable in the world, if at times a little clumsy. Arcus is great with other dogs, indifferent to cats, and adoring of people. His loves to be close to people- preferably, sitting on them and snuggling his big face into their shoulder while making contented little noises. Arcusâ\u0080\u0099 easy exuberance is infectious. \n\nArcus has a hilarious range of vocal stylings, from singing along to opera music to Chewbacca grumbles and tiny, high-pitched woofs. He would make a great guard dog with his baritone bark. Like most herding dogs, Arcus needs exercise and stimulation with at least 2 good walks a day. If bored or under-stimulated, he will tell you with his words. Arcus is a smart boy who already knows sit, down, and paw, and is working on off, leave it, and hush. Arcus has a type of coat that requires regular brushing, which he is fine with. \n\nArcus would love a canine sibling to play with and a fenced yard to stretch his long legs in. Due to his size, blindside, and belief that he is a lap dog, Arcus should be in a home without small children. If youâ\u0080\u0099re looking for a best bud who will love you unconditionally and keep you laughing, Arcus could be the boy for you! Arcus is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccinations, and house- and crate-trained. He is currently fostered in Chapel Hill, NC, and his adoption fee is $300.\n\nIf you are an approved applicant and are interested in Arcus please contact the adoption committee. If you are interested and not yet approved, please visit our website for adoption procedures and application.\n"
